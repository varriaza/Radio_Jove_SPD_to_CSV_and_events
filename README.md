# Radio_Jove_SPD_to_CSV_and_events

This code was developed for the University of Delaware Radio Jove program, by Victor Arriaza, for Dr. John Clem. Many thanks to 
David Daniels for providing helpful starter code for SPD conversion.

# This code does two things
1) Turns SPD files generated by Radio SkyPipe into CSV files
2) Reads these CSV files and looks for events by comparing information from a Radio Jupiter Pro report file. The event data
is then stored in a "_events" csv file.

# How To Get Scripts Working On A New Computer

os.chdir('C:\Users\spencer\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Radio-SkyPipe II\University_of_Delawa\\' + f_year_months + '\\' + file_name)   
to also have the same path + f_year_months + file_name


--- Prediction_Data_Reader.py ---
1) On line ~294 or:  
os.chdir('C:\Users\spencer\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Radio-SkyPipe II\\')  
change path to inside of folder that has the Radio Jupiuter Pro report
